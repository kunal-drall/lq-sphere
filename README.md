# LearnQuest: Decentralized Skill Verification and Collaborative Learning Marketplace

**LearnQuest** is a decentralized platform that transforms how people learn, verify skills, and monetize their knowledge through a gamified, community-driven ecosystem. The platform allows learners to earn dynamic, upgradeable NFT badges as proof of their skills, take community-created challenges, and earn tokens for learning and verifying others' skills.

## Features

### **Skill Validation NFTs**
- Users earn upgradeable NFT badges representing their skills.
- Badges are validated by the community through a consensus mechanism.
- Each badge includes skill level, learning path, and community endorsements.

### **Collaborative Learning Marketplace**
- Creators can upload micro-learning content (videos, tutorials, challenges).
- Learners can complete learning quests, take challenges, and get verified by peers.
- Learners and teachers can earn tokens for demonstrating and verifying skills.

### **Gamified Learning Mechanics**
- RPG-style progression system for skill development.
- Multiplayer learning challenges to boost team-based skill acquisition.
- Competitive leaderboards for skill domains.

### **Portable Credentials**
- Skill NFTs can be transferred across platforms, creating a universal learning passport.

## How It Works

1. **Skill Validation**: Users earn NFT badges by completing quests and challenges, which are verified by peers.
2. **Learning Marketplace**: Creators upload learning resources, and learners complete them to level up.
3. **Rewards**: Learners and creators earn tokens for demonstrating skills and contributing to the platform.
4. **Community Engagement**: Users can vote on the quality of content and verification challenges, ensuring content relevance.

## Built With

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (for API, authentication, and database)
- **Blockchain**: (Future feature - integration with blockchain for skill verification and NFTs)
- **UI Framework**: TailwindCSS (for responsive and customizable UI)
